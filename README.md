 Hello! This is the Team Who Shall Not Be Named workspace.
 Can we all try and edit the readme for practice?
 
 Caroline (done)
 Olivia (done)
 Kirsty (DONE)
 Gabrielle (NOT done)

Notes for Git/GitHub: - don't worry about this just yet though, since we still need to confirm an design idea etc.
! Remember to pull / fetch origin BEFORE making any changes on github desktop/downloaded files !
(or there'll be problems pushing/uploading changes to this online version)

CHANGELOG:
Caroline made folders for...
html (v basic template index file, stupid question but we need multiple files for different pages right?)
css (copy pasted bootstrap in - we can still add our own stylesheet to this folder)
javascript and images (both empty, don't seem to be showing up?)
